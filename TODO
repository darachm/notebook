- make a Makefile eventually to automate the use of the script for certain types
    of reports
- branch off to track the raw notebook, and setup a rsync/rclone call to back 
    up everything
- future-proof the YAML storage so I can make sure I can reformat it independent
    of the queries, maybe split the software up so it's parse-only and query
    only....
- refactor to make sure nothing can be over-written, and is findable in multiple
    ways
