To use:

- `touch book/raw_notebook.yaml`
- edit `notes.yaml` and write something, with tags in `t` and date in `d` 
    (ISO FORMAT PLZ), and notes in `n`, and associated files in `f`. A template
    is at `.notes.yaml` that is copied over each parsing, so you can copy in 
    manually to start over.
- Once you have something, run `python3 scripts/procnotes.py -p -t`. The `-t`
    means test, so it'll make a `test_report.html` from your entry.
- When it is to your liking (`notes.yaml` rendered in the `test_report.html`,
    then drop the `-t` flag and just run with `-q`.
- Then to make a notebook report, run with `-q SOMETHING` where `SOMETHING` is
    a tag you want to query out.

You can edit the `book/raw_notebook.yaml` directly and it should still all work
nicely. The hashes won't be accurate, but oh well.
